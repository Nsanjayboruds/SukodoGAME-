SUKODOGAME

🎮 About The Project
The "SukodoGAME-" project is a web game that uses a hybrid approach for its development. The core game logic is written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten for high performance. The user interface and frontend are built with a combination of JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Vite, which are modern web development tools. This structure allows the game to leverage the speed of C++ while providing a rich, interactive user experience in the browser.

💻 Getting Started

This section explains how to set up the project locally for development.

Prerequisites

    List any software a user needs to have installed, like Node.js, Docker, etc.

Bash

# Example
npm install -g some-cli-tool

Installation

    Clone the repository.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project

    Install the Node.js dependencies.

Bash

npm install

    Set up the Emscripten SDK using the emsdk directory.

    Build the C++ code to WebAssembly.

Bash

# Example command, you'll need to create this script
npm run build-cpp

    Start the development server.

Bash

npm run dev

The game should now be running on http://localhost:5173.
